/*Let's say your company pays once per month, on the 15th.

If it's already the 15th of the current month (or later), the previous pay period will run from the 15th of 
the previous month, to the 14th of the current month.

If on the other hand it's not yet the 15th of the current month, the previous pay period will run from the

15th two months ago to the 14th on the previous month.

Set up variables defining the beginning and end of the previous pay period in this scenario. Select the 
variables to ensure they are working properly.

Hint: In addition to incorporating date logic, you will probably also need to use CASE statements in 
one of your variable definitions.*/
